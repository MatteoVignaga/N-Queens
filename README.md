# N-Queens

## Introduction
The N-Queens is a **Constraint Satisfaction Problem** (CSP) where the task is to place a total of N queens on a chess board of NxN size, such that no pair of queens share the same row, column, diagonal or anti-diagonal placement. I have encountered this problem during my Artificial Intelligence course at UniMi, and I was intrigued by a very specific resolution: the Min-Conflicts algorithm.

In-depth readme coming soon...

You may change the speed at which the moves are made by changing the `delay` variable in the `utils.py` file.
